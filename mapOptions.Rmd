mapOptions Set options on a leaflet map object
Description
Set options on a leaflet map object
### Usage
mapOptions(map, zoomToLimits = c("always", "first", "never"))
### Arguments
map A map widget object created from leaflet()
zoomToLimits Controls whether the map is zooms to the limits of the elements on the map.
This is useful for interactive applications where the map data is updated. If
"always" (the default), the map always re-zooms when new data is received;
if "first", it zooms to the elements on the first rendering, but does not rezoom
for subsequent data; if "never", it never re-zooms, not even for the first
rendering.

mapOptions(zoomToLimits = "first")
