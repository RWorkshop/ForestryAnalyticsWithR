mapOptions Set options on a leaflet map object
Description
Set options on a leaflet map object
### Usage
mapOptions(map, zoomToLimits = c("always", "first", "never"))
### Arguments
map A map widget object created from leaflet()
zoomToLimits Controls whether the map is zooms to the limits of the elements on the map.
This is useful for interactive applications where the map data is updated. If
"always" (the default), the map always re-zooms when new data is received;
if "first", it zooms to the elements on the first rendering, but does not rezoom
for subsequent data; if "never", it never re-zooms, not even for the first
rendering.

# Don't auto-zoom to the objects (can be useful in interactive applications)

mapOptions(zoomToLimits = "first")

### Arguments
map a map widget object, possibly created from leaflet() but more likely from
leafletProxy()
layerId character vector; the layer id(s) of the item to remove
group the name of the group whose members should be removed
clusterId the id of the marker cluster layer
Value
the new map object
Note
When used with a leaflet() map object, these functions don’t actually remove the features from
the map object, but simply add an operation that will cause those features to be removed after they
are added. In other words, if you add a polygon "foo" and the call removeShape("foo"), it’s not
smart enough to prevent the polygon from being added in the first place; instead, when the map is
rendered, the polygon will be added and then removed.
For that reason, these functions aren’t that useful with leaflet map objects and are really intended
to be used with leafletProxy instead.

WMStile layers are extensions of tile layers, so they can also be removed or cleared via removeTiles()
or clearTiles().
