groupOptions Set options on layer groups

#### Description

Change options on layer groups. Currently the only option is to control what zoom levels a layer
group will be displayed at. The zoomLevels option is not compatible with layers control; do not
both assign a group to zoom levels and use it with addLayersControl.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
groupOptions(map, group, zoomLevels = NULL)
<code></pre>

#### Arguments
* map the map to modify
* group character vector of one or more group names to set options on
* zoomLevels numeric vector of zoom levels at which group(s) should be visible, or TRUE to display at all zoom levels

#### Examples

pal <- colorQuantile("YlOrRd", quakes$mag)
leaflet() %>%
# Basic markers
addTiles(group = "basic") %>%
addMarkers(data = quakes, group = "basic") %>%

# When zoomed in, we'll show circles at the base of each marker whose
# radius and color reflect the magnitude
addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite, group = "detail") %>%
addCircleMarkers(data = quakes, group = "detail", fillOpacity = 0.5,
radius = ~mag * 5, color = ~pal(mag), stroke = FALSE) %>%
# Set the detail group to only appear when zoomed in
groupOptions("detail", zoomLevels = 7:18)
